# Installation

You should install HuggingGAN in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're
unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). Create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going
to use and activate it.

## Installation with pip
```bash
pip install hugging-gan-test
```

Make sure it is working by running the following
```bash
python -c "import bigotis; print("WORKING!"))"
```
